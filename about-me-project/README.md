# About Me Practice Project

This is a simple personal website created as a practice project. It includes basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to demonstrate web development skills. The content is fictional and intended for learning purposes only.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the webpage.
- `final_project_images/`: A folder containing images used in the layout of the page.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to practice creating a personal website from scratch. It covers:
- Structuring a webpage with HTML.
- Styling with CSS.
- Adding basic interactivity with JavaScript.

## How to View the Project

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to:
- Add more interactive features using JavaScript.
- Make the website responsive for mobile devices.
- Enhance the design with more advanced CSS techniques.
