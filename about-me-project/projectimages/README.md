# Final Project Images

This folder contains all the image assets used in the **About Me practice project**. These images are used to enhance the design and layout of the personal website.

## Purpose of the Images

The images included here are used to create a more visually engaging webpage. They represent placeholders and are part of the learning process in building a personal website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to develop this project, I plan to:
- Replace these placeholder images with custom graphics.
- Optimize image sizes for faster loading times.
- Add more images as the website content evolves.
